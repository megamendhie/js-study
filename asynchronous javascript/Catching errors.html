	 Catching errors in fetch api
	 
	 To support error handling, Promise objects provide a catch() method.
	 This is a lot like then(): you call it and pass in a handler function.
	 However, while the handler passed to then() is called when the asynchronous operation succeeds,
	 the handler passed to catch() is called when the asynchronous operation fails.
	*/
	
	/*
	PROMISE STATES
	
	1)	pending: the promise has been created, and the asynchronous function it's associated with has not succeeded or failed yet.
	This is the state your promise is in when it's returned from a call to fetch(), and the request is still being made.
	
	2)	fulfilled: the asynchronous function has succeeded. When a promise is fulfilled, its then() handler is called.
	
	3)	rejected: the asynchronous function has failed. When a promise is rejected, its catch() handler is called.
