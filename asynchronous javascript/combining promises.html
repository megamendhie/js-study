	 Catching errors in fetch api
	 
	 To support error handling, Promise objects provide a catch() method.
	 This is a lot like then(): you call it and pass in a handler function.
	 However, while the handler passed to then() is called when the asynchronous operation succeeds,
	 the handler passed to catch() is called when the asynchronous operation fails.
